# Masking

Before being put through wave soldering, the board may need to be masked. Exposed contacts on the board that should not be soldered are covered with a masking compound. This is often a heat resistant tape.

Examples of things needing masking include bus interfaces, such as PCI and ISA. The PCI interface of the board shown below was masked before the through-hole components were soldered.
