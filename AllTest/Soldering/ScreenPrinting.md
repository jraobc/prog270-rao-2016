# Screen Printing

The surface mount process starts by screen printing solder paste onto a PCB.

## Solder paste

 The paste consists of small balls of solder and a tacky glue. It often needs to be refrigerated before use.

A lead solder or a lead-free solder may be used. Lead solder is most often 63% lead and 37% tin. This proportion, called a 'eutectic mixture', has the lowest melting point of all tin-lead alloys.

Common lead-free alloys include SAC (tin-silver-copper), indium rich alloys, and SnBi (tin-bismuth). 

## Printing

The paste is forced through a stencil and onto the PCB using a squeegee.
