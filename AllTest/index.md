# J Rao's Prog 270 site

<img src="/images/jgoat.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Me feeding a goat">

This site demonstrates skills I learned in Charle Calvert's Prog 270 course.


## Soldering 

I have created a few pages that discuss the process of circuit board production:

#### Surface Mount

- [This page](Soldering/SurfaceMountSoldering.html) describes the steps involved in mounting parts to the surface of a printed circuit board.

#### Through Hole

- [This page](Soldering/ThroughHole.html) explains the process of adding through-hole componenets, such as connectors and axial resistors.


## Web Design Tools

#### Markdown
Many of the pages on this site were generated with [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), a text-to-HTML conversion tool. These pages give examples of using Markdown:

- [Text and headings](PageDesign/Markdown/ExampleMarkdown.html)
- [Text formatting and images](PageDesign/Markdown/ExampleMarkdown2.html)
- [Lists and links](PageDesign/Markdown/Prog270TestRao.html)
- [Using preformatted text](PageDesign/Markdown/Ozymandias.html)
- [A page about Goats](PageDesign/Markdown/Goats.html)

#### Image Handling

These pages were created using tools provided by Charlie. They use [lwip](https://github.com/EyalAr/lwip), an imaging processing tool for NodeJS.

- [Canada](PageDesign/ImageHandling/canada.html)
- [California](PageDesign/ImageHandling/california.html)

#### Bootstrap

These pages demonstrate some features of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

- [Demo 1](PageDesign/Bootstrap/bootstrap-demo01.html)
- [Demo 2](PageDesign/Bootstrap/bootstrap-demo02.html)

#### Database and Maps

- [This page](PageDesign/Database-Mapping/presidents.html) fetches data from a mySQL database running on my server.
- [This page](PageDesign/Database-Mapping/WalkingMapRao.html) uses custom google maps to show some of my favorite trails.

For links to all of my pages, see [here](master-list.html).
