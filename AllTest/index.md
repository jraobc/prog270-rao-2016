## Soldering 

I have created a few pages that discuss the process of circuit board production:

#### Surface Mount

[This page](SurfaceMountSoldering.html) describes the steps involved in mounting parts to the surface of a printed circuit board.

#### Through Hole

[This page](ThroughHole.html) explains the process of adding through-hole componenets, such as connectors and axial resistors.


## Other pages

See [here](Summary.html).
